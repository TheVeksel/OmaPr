# Re-creation of Yle.fi

This pet project was created as a way to deepen my understanding of **React** and my favorite aspect of web development â€” the integration of frontend and backend, specifically the handling and display of server-side data. 

## Project Highlights
- **Frontend**: Built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **SCSS** for styling.  
  - **State Management**: Implemented with **Redux Toolkit**, which I found incredibly convenient and efficient.  
  - **Build Tool**: The project uses **WebPack** as its bundler.  
- **Backend**: The server side is powered by **Firebase Realtime Database**.  

This project allowed me to explore new technologies, and Iâ€™m thrilled with the experience and the results.

## Features
- Real-time data fetching and rendering from Firebase.
- Modular and scalable architecture.
- Modern state management with Redux Toolkit.
- Styled with SCSS for a clean and maintainable design.

## Current Status
The project is still a work in progress. The registration and authentication system is not fully implemented yet, but the core functionality is complete and works as intended.

## Demo
